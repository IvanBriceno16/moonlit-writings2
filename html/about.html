      <h3 class="product__title">Exploration</h3>
      <p class="product_description"> The purpose of my studies is to read the narrative of humanity that has been at play since the beginning of culture and is far too vast to possibly experience in our own short lifetimes. 
                                      Reading about the experiences of great people that have lived through times different than our own but have frequently run into the same problems we do. All humans have the faculty of experiencing the same emotions and reading about these people and seeing 
                                      their experiences lets us see the bigger picture. The human condition. If we learn from these, we can better understand our own situations and navigate life with a deeper perspective. Hopefully, in the end, we can add to the great narrative that is humanity. </p>

      <h3 class="product__title">Discussion</h3>
      <p class="product_description">I learned from a friend a while back what it's like to have a meaningful discussion. I compare it to a chess match. You put forth your opinion, they counter, and you go back and forth carefully 
                                      constructing your argument until one person trumps the other and you both come to a conclusion that leaves you itching for more. An exhilarating time really. This is what I hope to have more of. 
                                      Fun discussions that inspire people to think meaningfully about something.</p>

      <h3 class="product__title">Practice</h3>
      <p class="product_description">Reading great authors of the past inspires me to write myself and develop my own philosophy. I don't wish to merely copy them. I wish to create something of my own which I've carefully built by selecting things that I agree with and have 
                                    examined myself. I hope to write and inspire others to read and study like the great philosphers of the past have done for me. </p>
